This little JavaScript snippet allows you to have any element on a page act as a link, even if it is not an anchor tag.

New Syntax:
```html
<div href="http://example.com">This is a div that is also a link</div>
<div href="http://example.com" target="_blank">This is a div link, and will open in a new tab</div>
```

Old Syntax:
```html
<div>
  <a href="http://example.com">This is a div with a link inside of it</a>
</div>
<div>
  <a href="http://example.com" target="_blank">This is a div with a link that will open in a new tab</a>
</div>
```

It's easy, and simple!
