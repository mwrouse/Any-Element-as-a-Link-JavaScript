# DOM Elements as Links
This little JavaScript snippet allows you to have any element on a page act as a link, even if it is not an anchor tag.

## Syntax
The syntax for using any DOM Element as a link is extremely simple, all you do is add an href attribute to the element, and an option target attribute, just like you do on &lt;a&gt; tags.
```html
<span href="http://example.com">This is a link!</span>
<span href="http://example.com" target="_blank">This is a link that opens in a new tab!</span>
```
